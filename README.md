Code Repository for the frontend used in the AZUR project from the 2021 [Tech4Germany](tech.4germany.org) fellowship. This frontend calls upon a backend which is abstracted out as an API. The API is available on [the Tech4Germany GitHub](https://github.com/tech4germany/AZUR-API).

# AZUR

In the German Bundestag, various resources are allocated to parties according to their strengths in the plenum using one of three [proportionality calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation) methods - the Sainte-LaguÃ«/Schepers, d'Hondt, and Hare-Niemeyer methods. This includes, for example, the number of seats on committees, speaking time on the floor, and even things like floor space on open-door days. AZUR is an internally used calculator that applies these methods - this project is its third iteration, after one created in the 1970s and one created in 2000.

# AZUR-Frontend

This repository contains the implementation of the frontend for AZUR. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
